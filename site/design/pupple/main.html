	<h1>Pupple</h1>
	<h3>2008</h3>
	<p>A concept car I designed when I was 14, winning the Outstanding Design Award in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080220024248/www.michelinchallengedesign.com/MCD_2008/Site/mcd_gallery_2008/mcd_2008_gallery_d14.asp" target="_blank">2008 Michelin Challenge Design</a>. It was selected out of hundreds of international competitors to be displayed at the North American International Auto Show. The most interesting thing about the car is that the passenger compartment is suspended in a gimballed sphere to improve the safety of its occupants. Information of the outside world is displayed inside using cameras and screens. This 3D model was made in 3DS Max.</p>
