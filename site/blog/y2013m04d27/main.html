<p>Recently I moved my desktop computer to my bedroom in my parents' house, where I'll be staying for the summer. Consequently my internet speed has gone from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/2474736716.png">750 Mbps</a> in UBC to a mediocre ADSL connection that varies from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/2673834143.png">one hundred and fifty times worse</a> to <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/2673788634.png">one thousand times worse</a> at our house in Abbotsford.</p>
<p>I have also implemented an <a href="/blog/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for my blog.</p></section>
