Static version of the website.
=========
There now exists a [static version](http://www.dllu.net/s/) of this website for users without Javascript. Actually, the Javascript version that loads the pages asynchronously using AJAX has very few benefits over the static version. I suppose the only real benefit is my own poorly-written prefetch engine, which is somewhat buggy. In the Javascript version, the blog is more colourful but that is purely cosmetic. I might just replace the entire site with the static version in the future.

Now that final exams are finally over, I have time to work on interesting projects. At least, for a short while; before school starts again next term.

**Update** _y2014m02d19_ The static version is now served by default and the version that loads snippets via AJAX has been removed.
